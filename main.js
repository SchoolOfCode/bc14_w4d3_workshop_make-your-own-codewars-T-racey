You are a coach 🚲 for a professional🏆 bicycle racing team, 
and you need to analyse the results of the team's recent time trial. 
The time trial consisted of a single stage, and for each rider on the team, 
you have recorded the time that they took to complete the stage.
Write a function calculateAverageTime(results) that takes an array results as input, 
where results[i] represents the time (in minutes) that rider i took to complete the 
stage. Your function should calculate the average time taken by all riders and return 
it as a string with two decimal places.

For example, if the input results array is:

[20, 22, 24, 26, 28]

This represents a time trial with 5 riders on the team. Rider 1 
completed the stage in 20 minutes, rider 2 in 22 minutes, and so on. 

Assume that the number of riders on the team is between 1 and 10, 
and that the times are all positive integers.

👉//write your code here.
  function calculateAverageTime(arr) {
{

//Your function should calculate the average time taken by all riders and be returned as a string with two decimal places:
"24.00"🕔
